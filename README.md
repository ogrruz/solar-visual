# Solar System 3D visualisation projett
One of my projects as part of a coursework for my University of Portsmouth course. The project idea is to use object-oriented programming in a visual environment setting to produce a 3D Visualisation of our solar system with close approximations with regards to relative distances of orbits and orbital velocities of planets. The planet objects themselves, however are not up to exact scale as it would hinder the visual aspect of the model. Naturally, this project involves using geometry and mathematical calculations to approximate the movement of planets along their axii within space.

This project is developed within the Processing environment - an IDE with an integrated graphical library. Thus to run this project you need to install Processing and install the 2 dependencies: the Peasycam and ControlP5 libraries from within the application.
You may find the report for the created artifact here: [Report](https://github.com/ogrruz/solar-visual/blob/main/report.pdf)

## Directories

The directories here are progressive iterations of the artefact with generation 3 being the final version

* Generation1: first iteration. Generation of the parent planet object and children nodes wildly rotating around its axis

* Generation2: all objects generated and are rotating in random directions at approximately correct relative disatances  

* Generation3: final iteration. Correct Axii implemented, added texture and lighting
